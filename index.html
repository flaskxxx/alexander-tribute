                        <h2>Birth and Early life</h2>
                        <p>Alexander was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon,on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is uncertain). He was the son
                            of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth
                            to Alexander.</p>
                        <p>Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the&nbsp;sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about
                            whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the&nbsp;story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming, that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.</p>

                        <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
                        <p>When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor, and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the Academy to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose
                            Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In&nbsp;return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of&nbsp;Stageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the&nbsp;ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those
                            who were in exile. Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such&nbsp;as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his&nbsp;friends and future generals,
                            and are often known as the "Companions".</p>
                        <p>Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle
                            gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.</p>
                        <p>Alexander&nbsp;was able to quote Euripides from memory. Alexander and Bucephalus by&nbsp;Domenico Maria Canuti, 17th century During his youth, Alexander was also&nbsp;&nbsp;acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court,
                            who received the&nbsp;protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Artaxerxes&nbsp;III.</p>
                        <p>Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine, possible&nbsp;future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to&nbsp;342 BC, as well as Amminapes, future satrap of Alexander, or a Persian nobleman&nbsp;named
                            Sisines. This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge&nbsp;of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the&nbsp;management of the Macedonian state. Suda writes that Anaximenes of Lampsacus&nbsp;was
                            one of Alexander's teachers, and that Anaximenes also accompanied Alexander&nbsp;on his campaigns.</p>
                        <h2 id="regency"><strong>Regency and ascent of Macedon</strong></h2>
                        <p>At the age of 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip II had waged war against the Thracians to the north, which left Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent.</p>
                        <p>During Philip's absence, the Thracian tribe of Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory. The territory was colonized, and a city, named Alexandropolis, was founded. Upon
                            Philip's return, Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander reportedly saved his father's life.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. While Philip was occupied in Thrace, Alexander was
                            ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern <br>Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians
                            invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.</p>
                        <p>Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, Philip II of Macedon, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Alexander's father
                            Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia.</p>
                        <p>Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes's favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes
                            and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.<br></p>
                        <p>As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According
                            to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line.<br></p>
                        <p>Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were
                            surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.<br></p>
                        <p>After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Chaeronea Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip
                            established a "Hellenic Alliance" (modelled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as "Supreme Commander")
                            of this <br>league (known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.<br></p>
                        <h2 id="reign">King of Macedon</h2>
                        <p>In summer 336 BC, while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias. As Pausanias tried to escape, he
                            tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, Perdiccas and Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20.<br></p>
                        <p>Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed, but spared a third, Alexander
                            Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance
                            guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.<br></p>
                        <p>Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous
                            to leave alive.&nbsp;Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias. News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly,
                            and the Thracian <br>tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly.<br></p>
                        <p>He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered,
                            adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese.<br></p>
                        <p>Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander
                            and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the
                            sunlight.<br></p>
                        <p>This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said "But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes." At Corinth, Alexander took the title of Hegemon ("leader") and, like Philip, was appointed
                            commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.<br></p>
                        <h2 id="personality"><strong>Personality</strong></h2>
                        <p>Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences. However, he had little interest in sports or the Olympic Games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma
                            and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander
                            had the ability to do so.<br></p>
                        <p>During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery
                            of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless
                            ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical A Roman copy of an cliché.<br></p>
                        <p>He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify <br>himself. Olympias Alexander the Great, always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun
                            at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus - Ammon.&nbsp;Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, which was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing
                            the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes; however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the Macedonians, and they were unwilling to perform it.<br></p>
                        <p>This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king
                            was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.<br></p>
                        <h2 id="death"><strong>Death</strong></h2>
                        <p>On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two different versions of Alexander's death, and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account
                            is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common
                            soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.<br></p>
                        <p>In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever, instead dying after some
                            agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim. Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus,
                            Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned.<br></p>
                        <p>Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless
                            fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the
                            fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.<br></p>
                        <p>The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating
                            the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander.In a 2014 manuscript
                            in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance.<br></p>
                        <p>Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was <br>suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause. Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances
                            of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.<br></p>
                        <p>Several natural causes (diseases) have been suggested, including malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending
                            paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis.[158] Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize
                            that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.<br></p>
